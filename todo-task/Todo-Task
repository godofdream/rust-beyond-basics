# Task: Building a Command-Line Todo List

Description:
Create a command-line todo list application using Rust. The application should allow users to add tasks, mark tasks as completed, view the list of tasks, and remove tasks. 

Here are the specific requirements:

The application should have the following commands:

add <task>: Adds a new task to the todo list.
complete <task_index>: Marks the task at the specified index as completed.
list: Displays the list of tasks with their indices.
remove <task_index>: Removes the task at the specified index from the list.
The todo list should be stored in memory using appropriate data structures.

The application should handle incorrect command usage gracefully and provide meaningful error messages.

Implement appropriate error handling mechanisms to handle potential errors during the execution of commands.

The application should have a clean and user-friendly interface with clear instructions.

Bonus (Optional):
Add functionality to persist the todo list to a file so that it can be loaded and saved between runs.
Implement additional features such as editing tasks, prioritizing tasks, or filtering tasks based on their status.
